# Summary
- 词法分析/语法分析，构建语法树AST
- SSA优化，构建目标文件object file
- 链接对应的库(runtime)等，构建ELF


# 1. 理解语法树AST




# 2. 符号Symbol定义

```Go
type Sym struct {
	SymID         // symbol identifier (name and version)
	Kind  SymKind // kind of symbol
	DupOK bool    // are duplicate definitions okay?
	Size  int64   // size of corresponding data
	Type  SymID   // symbol for Go type information
	Data  Data    // memory image of symbol
	Reloc []Reloc // relocations to apply to Data
	Func  *Func   // additional data for functions
}
```

```Go
type SymKind uint8

const (
	// An otherwise invalid zero value for the type
	Sxxx SymKind = iota
	// Executable instructions
	STEXT
	// Read only static data
	SRODATA
	// Static data that does not contain any pointers
	SNOPTRDATA
	// Static data
	SDATA
	// Statically data that is initially all 0s
	SBSS
	// Statically data that is initially all 0s and does not contain pointers
	SNOPTRBSS
	// Thread-local data that is initially all 0s

	// Debugging data

	SDWARFABSFCN
	SDWARFTYPE
	SDWARFVAR

	// ABI alias. An ABI alias symbol is an empty symbol with a
	// single relocation with 0 size that references the native
	// function implementation symbol.
	//
	// TODO(austin): Remove this and all uses once the compiler
	// generates real ABI wrappers rather than symbol aliases.
	SABIALIAS
	// Coverage instrumentation counter for libfuzzer.
	SLIBFUZZER_EXTRA_COUNTER
	// Update cmd/link/internal/sym/AbiSymKindToSymKind for new SymKind values.
)
```


# 3. 重定位Reloc定义

```Go
// A Reloc describes a relocation applied to a memory image to refer
// to an address within a particular symbol.
type Reloc struct {
	// The bytes at [Offset, Offset+Size) within the containing Sym
	// should be updated to refer to the address Add bytes after the start
	// of the symbol Sym.
	Offset int64
	Size   int64
	Sym    SymID
	Add    int64

	// The Type records the form of address expected in the bytes
	// described by the previous fields: absolute, PC-relative, and so on.
	// TODO(rsc): The interpretation of Type is not exposed by this package.
	Type RelocType
}
```

	// Platform dependent relocations. Architectures with fixed width instructions
	// have the inherent issue that a 32-bit (or 64-bit!) displacement cannot be
